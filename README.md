# Front-end
My Front-end work

Front-end development 

    It builds the user-facing part of websites/apps (what you see and interact with), using core technologies HTML (structure), CSS (styling/layout), 
     and JavaScript (interactivity/logic) to create responsive, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces like buttons, menus, and forms, 
     ensuring a smooth user experience (UX) that communicates with the server-side (backend). 
     
Core Technologies

    HTML (HyperText Markup Language): 
    
      Defines the content and structure of the page (headings, paragraphs, images).
    
      Introduced in 1993 and now at HTML5, it is a core language for creating structured web content. 
      It supports forms, tables, and other elements needed to organize information, and continues to evolve to help developers build interactive, accessible interfaces across platforms.

    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 
    
      Controls the presentation, layout, colors, and fonts (styling).

      Introduced on 17 December 1996 and now at CSS3, stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It complements HTML by adding styling, managing colors, and enabling responsive designs. 
      CSS helps developers create visually appealing, consistent layouts across devices and screen sizes.

    JavaScript (JS): 
    
      Adds dynamic features, interactivity, animations, and complex logic in the browser (client-side). 

      Introduced on 4 December 1995 and now at ECMAScript 2022, is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded language.
      It enables dynamic updates and event handling in web development, making it key for building interactive and responsive user interfaces.

Key Concepts & Tools

    User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX): 
          Focuses on making the site intuitive, engaging, and visually pleasing.
    Client-Side: 
          The part of the application that runs in the user's browser, as opposed to the server-side (backend).
    Responsiveness: 
          Ensuring the site looks and works well on all devices (desktops, tablets, phones).
    Frameworks & Libraries: 
          Tools that speed up development (e.g., React, Angular, Vue for JS; Bootstrap for CSS).
    APIs: 
          How the front-end communicates with the back-end to fetch or send data.
